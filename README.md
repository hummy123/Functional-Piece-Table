# Purely Functional Piece Table in F#

## ðŸ›‘ Deprecation notice 

This repository has been deprecated [in favour of a Rope implementation](https://github.com/hummy123/FSharp-Rope) that is both simpler and more performant.

## Introduction

This is a purely functional Piece Table written in F#. A Piece Table is a data structure that has often been used in text editors such as Visual Studio/Code and AbiWord. 

For more information about the Piece Table data structure, [this repository](https://github.com/veler/Csharp-Piece-Table-Implementation) provides some helpful introductory links.

This particular implementation contains a Piece Table with the Pieces stored in a type of balanced binary tree (an AA Tree) which helps to perform insert, deletion and substring operations in O(log n) time.
