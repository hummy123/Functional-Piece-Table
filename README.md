# Purely Functional Piece Table in F#

This is a purely functional Piece Table written in F#. A Piece Table is a data structure that has often been used in text editors such as Visual Studio/Code and AbiWord. 

For more information about the Piece Table data structure, [this repository](https://github.com/veler/Csharp-Piece-Table-Implementation) provides some helpful introductory links.

This branch contains a plain Piece Table, intended as a starting point for transforming it into a more efficient one using concepts such as zippers and self-balancing binary trees.
